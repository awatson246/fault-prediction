# Fault Prediction Demo
A quick little demo for fault prediction using continuous and discrete data with some explainability thrown in because data about data makes me happy.


This is initially built off of this synthetic dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thegoanpanda/fault-prediction-in-tablet-press-equipment
  but it works for any synthetic dataset with a binary fault/failure output. 

I'm using SHAP (https://github.com/shap/shap) for explainability.

This is a testing ground for an ongoing project.
